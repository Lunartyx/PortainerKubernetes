# PortainerSwarm

This is a full tutorial to set up a Portainer Envoirenment with a company Setup

# Install a Container Env to launch microservices 🐧

This Project helps you build a Container environment with Portainer on a Kubernetes base.

To start I've set up a debian 12 server on VMWare Workstation
<br  />

# Setting up the server 💻

First things first we set up some extra services which are useful
Change you user to root with <br />
`su - root`

update you system with<br />
`apt update` <br />
`apt upgrade`
<br  />

## Firewall installation & config 🧱

First we install "Uncomplicated Firewall". Like the name says its a easy to use Firewall.<br />
`apt install -y ufw`

To configure this we can use other commands.<br />
`ufw allow ssh && ufw allow 80/tcp && ufw allow 443/tcp`

To configure the services later we should also allow some other ports.<br />
`ufw allow 9443/tcp`

To apply the changes and enable ufw use the following command<br />
`ufw enable`
<br  />

# Setting up the base Infrastructure 🏠

## Docker Swarm installation 🐳

First we install this packages to handle the certificates<br />
`apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg2 software-properties-common`

To check if the download isn't hacked we download the certificate from docker<br />
`curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | apt-key add -`

Change the writing permission to the certificate<br />
`add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian $(lsb_release -cs) stable"`

To add the docker's packages to apt copy paste the following command<br />
`apt update`

Now we install docker<br />
`apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin`

To test if docker is successfully installed run the hello world container<br />
`docker run hello-world`

After the docker installation we create a swarm.<br />
`docker swarm init --advertise-addr <YOUR IP ADDRESS>`
<br  />

## Portainer installation 🏗️

To install portainer to our cluster we use this command<br />
`curl -L https://downloads.portainer.io/ce2-19/portainer-agent-stack.yml -o portainer-agent-stack.yml`<br />

`docker stack deploy -c portainer-agent-stack.yml portainer`

You will need to wait about a minute until the container is fully up. After that you can access the Webinterface with your ip.<br />

`https://<YOUR IP ADDRESS>:9443/#!/init/admin`

After you set you password you may be asked to restart your container. To do so list you containers and restart it.<br />
`docker container ls`<br />
Important take the portainer-ce container<br />
`docker restart <container ID>`
<br />

## Portainer config ⚙️

Now we create a new environment for our containers.
We go over to environments and click on Docker Swarm, then start Wizard.

Now there are different ways to install the environment. I prefer the agent.
So we click on agent

We can find a command there to set up a new image. we copy this in a notepad and edit some parameters<br />

> --name portainer_agent<br />

Im changing it to `swarm_public`<br />
optionally you can change the port too

> -p 9001:9001/tcp<br />

But i leave it as it is.<br />

We can copy paste the whole command on our server and run it<br />

On our web UI we now insert the name and environment address<br />

> swarm_public<br /> > <YOUR IP ADDRESS><br />

We click on connect and the work is done. You successfully set up a portainer environment!
<br />

# Microservices 📲

What whould a infrastructure be without some services?
I will explane here how to set up a microservice environment with a reverse proxy, a loadbalancer, a frontent, a backend, an api server and a monitoring tool
<br />

## NGINX Reverse Proxy Manager 📯

Now we set up a reverse proxy.
To do so we go over to our swarm_public environment.

First we set up 2 volumes. For that we go to volumes and add a volume.
This is my naming:

> reverseproxy_certs<br />
> reverseproxy_data<br />

Now we create the template

Under app template to custom template.
We add a custom template.

Here are the parameters i've used.

> Title: nginx_reverse_proxy_manager<br />
> Descr.: nginx_reverse_proxy_manager<br />
> Ico.URL: https://nginxproxymanager.com/icon.png<br />
> Platform: Linux<br />
> Type: Swarm<br />

As the docker compose file i used ./images/compose/nginx_reverse_proxy_manager.docker-compose
